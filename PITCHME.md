It is written for unbiased presentation, without presuming preexisting knowledge.

### What the US Constitution Says


"***The President***, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, ***shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of***, Treason, ***Bribery***, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors." - [US Constitution, Article 2, Section 4.](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-4--2)

(Emphasis mine)

### Legal Definition of Bribery


"***Whoever"***—
...

2. "***being a public official"*** or person selected to be a public official, "***directly or indirectly, corruptly demands, seeks,"*** receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept "***anything of value personally"*** or for any other person or entity, "***in return for:"***

"***a. being influenced in the performance of any official act;"***

...
" - [US Code § 201](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201)

---

### Which means

Directly or indirectly demanding "anything of value personally" in exchange for "being influenced in the performance of an official act" is **bribery**, and the Constitution says "The President shall be removed on impeachment and conviction" of that.

---

### Did Donald Trump seek a thing of value in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act?

---

### Claims Required For Proof

1. Trump sought/demanded an exchange of:
2. an official act (dispensing Ukraine aid passed by Congress)
3. for a thing of value ("investigations")
4. that "investigations" were ***solely*** a thing of value personally, and ***not*** part of executing his job as President

---

Without _all four_ of those things, there is no bribery.

Without seeking/a demand, there is no bribery.
Without the "thing of value" that is not part of his job, there is no bribery.

(But note: the transaction doesn't have to go through.  The demand itself is sufficient.)

### "Irregular" Diplomatic Channels

"I encountered an irregular, informal channel of US policy-making with respect to Ukraine, unaccountable to Congress, a channel that included then-Special Envoy Kurt Volker, US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and, as I subsequently learned, Mr. Giuliani."

### "Irregular" Diplomatic Channels Conclusion:

Sondland, Volker, Giuliani, and Mulvaney were in a diplomatic backchannel unaccountable to Congress.

### The July 10 Meeting

"Bolton ended meeting when Sondland discussed requirement of specific investigations "deliverable" for meeting with Trump to Ukrainians."

### The July 10 Meeting Conclusions

Sondland told Ukrainians about investigations "deliverable" being required for meeting with Trump on July 10.

---

### Sondland's Perspective

"Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes. Mr. Giuliani conveyed to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and others that President Trump wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing to investigations of Burisma and the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani expressed those requests directly to the Ukrainians and Mr. Giuliani also expressed those requests directly to us."[Source](https://youtu.be/EkN4P7R5stE?t=5554)

### Sondland's Perspective

"That resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we have been discussing for many weeks.”
