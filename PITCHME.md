It is written for unbiased presentation, without presuming preexisting knowledge.

### What the US Constitution Says


"***The President***, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, ***shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of***, Treason, ***Bribery***, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors." - [US Constitution, Article 2, Section 4.](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-4--2)

(Emphasis mine)

### Legal Definition of Bribery


"***Whoever"***—
...

2. "***being a public official"*** or person selected to be a public official, "***directly or indirectly, corruptly demands, seeks,"*** receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept "***anything of value personally"*** or for any other person or entity, "***in return for:"***

"***a. being influenced in the performance of any official act;"***

...
" - [US Code § 201](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201)

### Which means

Directly or indirectly demanding "anything of value personally" in exchange for "being influenced in the performance of an official act" is **bribery**, and the Constitution says "The President shall be removed on impeachment and conviction" of that.

---

### Did Donald Trump seek a thing of value in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act?

---

### Claims Required For Proof

1. Trump sought/demanded an exchange of:
2. an official act (dispensing Ukraine aid passed by Congress)
3. for a thing of value ("investigations")
4. that "investigations" were ***solely*** a thing of value personally, and **not** part of executing his job as President

---

Without _all four_ of those things, there is no bribery.

Without seeking/a demand, there is no bribery.
Without the "thing of value" that is not part of his job, there is no bribery.

(But note: the transaction doesn't have to go through.  The demand itself is sufficient.)
