## An Objective Impeachment Guide

---

This is an non-partisan, definition-and-evidence heavy summary of the current impeachment case against Donald Trump.

It is written for unbiased presentation, without presuming preexisting knowledge.

### What the US Constitution Says


"***The President***, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, ***shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of***, Treason, ***Bribery***, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors." - [US Constitution, Article 2, Section 4.](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-4--2)

(Emphasis mine)

---

### Legal Definition of Bribery


"***Whoever"***—
...

2. "***being a public official"*** or person selected to be a public official, "***directly or indirectly, corruptly demands, seeks,"*** receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept "***anything of value personally"*** or for any other person or entity, "***in return for:"***

"***a. being influenced in the performance of any official act;"***

...
" - [US Code § 201](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201)

---

### Which means

"The President shall be removed on impeachment and conviction" of "directly or indirectly demanding anything of value personally in exchange for being influenced in the performance of an official act".

("Quid pro quo" means "this for that", and describes the "exchange" part.)

---

### What we will cover

Part 1. The impeachment case, with requirements, facts, and testimony
Part 2. Counterarguments made by Republicans

---

### Part 1: Did Donald Trump seek a thing of value in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act?

---

### Claims Required For Proof

1. Trump sought/demanded an exchange of:
2. an official act (white house meeting or dispensing Ukraine aid passed by Congress)
3. for a thing of value ("investigations")
4. that "investigations" were ***solely*** a thing of value personally, and ***not*** part of executing his job as President

---

Without _all four_ of those things, there is no bribery.

Without seeking/a demand, there is no bribery.
Without the "thing of value" that is not part of his job, there is no bribery.

(But note: the transaction doesn't have to go through.  The demand itself is sufficient.  For example, if a teacher says "sleep with me to pass the class" and the student calls the cops, it doesn't matter if no sex happened; the solicitation itself is illegal.)

##### Taylor: Who are the actors?

AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER, I
ENCOUNTERED AN IRREGULAR
INFOLLOW CHANNEL OF U.S. POLICY
MAKING UNACCOUNTABLE TO
CONGRESS, A CHANNEL THAT
INCLUDED THEN SPECIAL ENJOY KURT
VOLKER, U.S. AMBASSADOR GORDON
SONDLOND, RICK PERRY, MICK
MULVANEY AND AS I SUBSEQUENTLY
LEARNED, MR. GIULIANI.
I WAS CLEARLY IN THE REGULAR
CHANNEL, BUT I WAS ALSO IN THE
IRREGULAR ONE TO THE EXPENT THAT
AMBASSADORS VOLKER AND SONDLAND
INCLUDED ME IN CERTAIN
CONVERSATIONS.

### "Irregular" Diplomatic Channels Conclusion:

Sondland, Volker, Giuliani, and Mulvaney were in a diplomatic backchannel unaccountable to Congress.

##### Sondland's Perspective

+++

##### Sondland's Perspective

"Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes. Mr. Giuliani conveyed to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and others that President Trump wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing to investigations of Burisma and the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani expressed those requests directly to the Ukrainians and Mr. Giuliani also expressed those requests directly to us."[Source](https://youtu.be/EkN4P7R5stE?t=5554)

##### Sondland: Was the aid withheld to induce investigation announcement?

I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK
HIM FOR HIS CANDID IMPRESSION OF
THE PRESIDENT'S VIEWS ON
UKRAINE.
IN PARTICULAR, I ASKED
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND IF IT WAS
TRUE THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT
GIVE AN EXPLETIVE ABOUT UKRAINE.
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND AGREED THE
PRESIDENT DID NOT GIVE AN
EXPLETIVE ABOUT UKRAINE.
I ASKED WHY NOT.
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND STATED THE
PRESIDENT ONLY CARES ABOUT BIG
STUFF.
I NOTED THERE WAS BIG STUFF
GOING ON IN UKRAINE, LIKE A WAR
WITH RUSSIA.
AMBASSADOR SONDLAND REPLIED HE
MEANT BIG STUFF THAT BENEFITS
THE PRESIDENT, LIKE THE BIDEN
INVESTIGATION, THAT MR. GIULIANI
WAS PUSHING.
THE CONVERSATION THEN MOVED ON
TO OTHER TOPICS.

##### Mulvaney: Was the aid withheld to induce investigation announcement?


report demand for an investigation into
the Democrats was part of the reason
that he it was on to withhold funding to
Ukraine we look back to what happened in
2016

certainly was was part of the thing that
he was worried about in corruption with
that nation and that is absolutely a
broken yeah which which ultimately then
flowed by the way there was a report

##### Sondland: Was the aid withheld to induce investigation announcement?

Sondland Testimony:

+++

##### Sondland: Was the aid withheld to induce investigation announcement?

I TRIED DILIGENTLY TO ASK WHY
THE AID WAS SUSPENDED BUT I
NEVER RECEIVED A CLEAR ANSWER.
STILL HAVEN'T TO THIS DAY.
IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY CREDIBLE
EXPLANATION FOR THE SUSPENSION
OF AID, I LATER CAME TO BELIEVE
THAT THE RESUMPTION OF SECURITY
AID WOULD NOT OCCUR UNTIL THERE
WAS A PUBLIC STATEMENT FROM
UKRAINE COMMITTING TO THE
INVESTIGATIONS OF THE 2016
ELECTIONS AND BURISMA AS
MR. GIULIANI HAD DEMANDED.

Morrison's Testimony:

(September meeting with Yermak)
+++

##### Morrison on Sondland: Was the aid withheld to induce investigation announcement?


"WHAT DID AMBASSADOR SONDLAND
TELL YOU THAT HE TOLD MR.
YERMAK?"

"THAT THE UKRAINIANS WOULD
HAVE TO HAVE THE PROSECUTOR
GENERAL MAKE A STATEMENT WITH
RESPECT TO THE INVESTIGATIONS AS
A CONDITION OF HAVING THE AID
LIFTED."
